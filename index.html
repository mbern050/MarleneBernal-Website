        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello! My name is Marlene Bernal. I am a first-year student at the University of California Riverside. I am currently majoring in Business Economics but am in the process of changing it to the Pre-Business program. I was born and Raised here in Riverside, so it was not so hard for me to get adjusted to the environment as I had taken a lot of high school trips to this university. I have accomplished many things in my 18 years of living that make me believe that i am suitable for this position.
<br><br>
        Ever since I was young, I have been involved. I have been part of many clubs and organizations since elementary school. As a kid I was in the school's Theater Club from the grades 3rd-6th(when I was promoted). In this club I was not only able to help around with props and practices but, I was also able to keep the younger students entertained. I would sign up for every event that was being hosted and would not hesitate to take on leadership positions. I continued with my involvement into middle school as I played two sports and was in a leadership club called web, where I would help newer students get comfortable with the new environment. My first two years of high school were the peak of my involvement. I was in three different sports, and was in a total of five different clubs. I was extremely busy but I enjoyed being involved and occupied. I never once found myself bored as I always had something to do. Outside of school, I went to church twice a week and joined the Riverside Police Explorer Post.
<br><br>

        One of my proudest moments of my life was being in the Explorers Program. I learned many essential skills that would help me later on in life. We met up once a week for about five hours and worked on many different things such as physical training, and we were given many lessons and scenarios of police work. I was able to participate in many community events and through this program alone, I worked up more than 500 hours of community service. In this program I was able to take on many leadership roles as I was in charge of a couple of the events that I participated in. I began to work at the age of 16, my first job was in fast food, I worked at Wienerschnitzel. Although this wasn't my ideal job, I was happy that I was able to get a job at such a young age. This job created many memories for me as I worked with people of all ages, and I was able to appreciate every one of my coworkers. This job helped me take a step of independence as it is where I earned my own money. I left this job after a year because I decided that it was time for me to try something new. I was offered a job at spoonful yogurt cafe and I have been working there ever since and I love it! It is so far the best job that I have ever had and I love my working environment. Overall, these these three have helped me grow as a person as they have taught me how to work with others, independence, and so many other things that make me a better person.
